# Lung-infection-diagnosis-with-Computer-Vision-(AI)-

Artificial Intelligence has evolved a lot and is currently able to solve problems that are very complex and require human specialization. In the healthcare sector, in the field of disease diagnosis, AI through computer vision can be used to analyze medical images. Such medical images are such as X-rays, CT scans and MRIs where relevant information that can aid in the diagnosis of various diseases is extracted.

In this work we shall use X - ray images. In the health sector, X - ray images are used in the following ways but not limited to detection of lung problems: X-rays can be used to identify problems with the lungs such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or other conditions.
