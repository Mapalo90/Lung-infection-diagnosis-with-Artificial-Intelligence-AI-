# Lung-infection-diagnosis-with-Computer-Vision-

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has evolved a lot and is currently able to solve problems that are very complex and require human specialization. In the healthcare sector that deals with disease diagnosis, AI through computer vision can be used to analyze medical images. Such medical images are for example X-rays, CT scans and MRIs where relevant information that can aid in the diagnosis of various diseases is extracted.

In the health sector, X - ray images are used in the following ways but not limited to detection of lung problems: X-rays can be used to identify problems with the lungs such as pneumonia, lung cancer, or other conditions.

In this work, computer vision algorithms will be used to train the model about lung infection and then used to detect healthy and infected lungs from a given sample.
